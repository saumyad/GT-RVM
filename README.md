# GT-RVM
Implement a recoverable virtual memory system like the ones described in the LRVM and Rio Vista papers. Users of your library can create persistent segments of memory and then access them in a sequence of transactions. Making the memory persistent is simple: mirror each segment of memory to a backup file on disk. The difficult part is implementing transactions. If the client crashes, or if the client explicitly requests an abort, the memory should be returned to the state it was in before the transaction started.  To implement a recoverable virtual memory system you should use one or more log files. Before writing changes directly to the backup file, you must first write the intended changes to a log file. Then, if the program crashes, it is possible to read the log and see what changes were in progress.
